# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is live on [here](https://video-player-jubair.netlify.app).y

# Project Design Pattern

>## We are not going to use any external dependencies, we will only use open sourced video for our player.

> We will make our custom hook to control our video states from one place.
> From there we will get video time, volume, duration etc.
> We will control functionalities like video play/pause, sound mute/unMute from this custom hook with onClick events.

> ## Listen to key events to 
- Stop or play video on "Space" btn pressed
- Forward or Backward Video for 10 second when "ArrowRight" or "ArrowLeft" is pressed.

> ## Styling the video component using CSS.

> ## Show animation using LOTTIE animation when any btn is clicked.
